## Tech Stack ##

* AspNet Core v1.1.2

## Implementation Summary ##

* Separate task and event clients implemented to communicate with outlook API
* `TokenMiddleware` checks token key presented or not.
* `TokenProvider` (per request) gets token from header and supply to consumers which are clients to forward it to outlook.com 
* `ToDoService` implementation uses them and performs api calls in parallel to combine responses as required
* There is configurable `retry` handler (DelegatingHandler) using `Polly` for `HttpClient` to retry failed requests with given retrycount

### Integration Testing ###
* There is  `refresh token` handler (DelegatingHandler) in integration tests for `HttpClient` to refresh access token when request failed with http status `Unauthorized`
* Implemented custom `TestServer` (starts server using `Startup` class) and creates client with additional http handlers (i.e refresh token handler) to perform requests to api
